# Car Configurator

# Description

The app you have to build is a simplified version of https://www.tesla.com/modelx/design.
You can use that website for inspiration if you want, but our API and possible configurations are a lot simpler.
In this challenge, we focus on selecting a car model and color.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
